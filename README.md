**Toggle Design Mode Browser Extension**

A simple Firefox extension to toggle design mode on a web page. You can bind a keyboard shortcut to it. 

It also toggles the icon for the extension in the toolbar and changes caret color so that it is easy to identify if you are currently in design mode. The ones in the extension store did not have visual feedback about being in the design mode.

This is a good alternative to caret mode browsing: it allows for text selection in the browser with keyboard using macOS standard shortcuts (e.g., ⌘ + ⇧ + ←, ⌘ + ⇧ + →) which don't work in caret mode.
